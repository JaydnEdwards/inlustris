A tarot deck is a deck of 78 cards, composed of the 22 Major Arcana cards and 56 Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana are all named, distinct cards that tackle large, more vague themes. The Minor Arcana can be more specific, weaving a wider story, and are made up of 4 suites:

- Swords
- Wands
- Pentacles
- Cups

These suites start at Ace, and go up to King for a total of 14 cards in each suite.

Each card has imagery designed to tell a story and convey a meaning, to help you understand yourself and divine the future. For example, [The World](/major-arcana/the-world) represents success, completion and travel so in **Inlustris Tarot**, the art is of a woman dancing upon the world.

Typically, a card in a tarot deck is 70mm x 120mm, though there are other sizes that are out there.

### Does tarot actually tell the future?
Well, that's for you to decide. I've given successful readings where the outcomes have come to fruition. Keep in mind, however, that the interpretation of the cards is all up to you and things don't always turn out like you expect. Also, things that come up in readings aren't concrete and your fate is in **your** hands. Don't forget that readers are wrong sometimes too! We are all only human, after all, and we can mess up.

### How does it work?
That depends on how you want to use it!

The most common way, and the way I use, is to shuffle the cards with a question in mind. Then, I place down as many cards as I feel like I need into a spread. Sometimes I add more during the reading too. These cards then tell me a story. I look to the meanings of each card and what that could mean in regards to my question.

Other people use tarot in other ways, like asking yes or no questions. However, I prefer having at least 3 or more cards.

### Are the cards magic?
I believe that it's up to the person handling the cards and their intuition that commands the reading, along with some divine intervention in the form of your spirit guides. The cards are just a way for you to have a visual prompt.

I don't believe that cards themselves have anything inherently magical about them. You can use any deck for divination, and some people manage to use standard playing cards.

### Where can I learn the meanings?
Every card I design has a page on this website. You can learn my interpretations here. However, if they don't click then I can also recommend [Biddy Tarot](https://www.biddytarot.com/tarot-card-meanings/) and [Tarot Guide](https://www.thetarotguide.com/).

I've used these both before, and I can get behind the interpretations on both.
