The Death card is not about the literal death of any person. Worry not - this is an ending to allow for something new, like the end of winter for the birth of spring.

If you get this card, you may be about to undergo a transition. Something may be coming to and end, but that usually comes with a new opportunity. These changes can be stressful or disruptive, but you should be better off for it.
