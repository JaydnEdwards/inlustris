meaning:
    general: 'Judgement represents the judgement of the self and others, as well as being called to make life-changing decisions.'
    example: "If you get this card then you may be being judged too harshly by others, or you may be the one judging. It also represents something calling you to pursue - this might be a new-found passion or talent. It also represents you needing to make one or more decisions that could completely change your life, even if you don't know which choices those are yet."
