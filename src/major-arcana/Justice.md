Justice represents justice, as well as cause and effect. Actions have consequences and those consequences are coming.

If you get this card then there are a few outcomes to look out for. If you are seeking justice, then this card is a good sign for you. However, if you have wronged someone then your actions may be about to come to light. You may also need to look at how you balance your work, personal time and love life. In a love setting, Justice can represent a lawyer or a Libra, but it can also represent the contract of marriage, or the breaking of that contract.
