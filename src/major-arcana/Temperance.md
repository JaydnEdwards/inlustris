Temperance represents balance and the need to keep calm, as well as feeling content in your relationships.

If you get this card then you're being told to remain calm and have patience. You may feel like you're being tugged in multiple directions, so take a step back and weigh the options. Don't rush into decisions and don't let yourself be dragged into the other's problems. Your own balance and tranquility is important. 

In love, this card also represents that you have a harmonious relationship, or call you to consider your partner's viewpoints and walk a middle-ground.
