meaning:
    general: 'Temperance represents sexuality, the feeling of being trapped and the need to work on your shadow self.'
    example: "If you get this card then you may be in a situation where you feel trapped, or where something isn't working for you. Know that in these situations, you can usually take steps to free yourself. You may also be experimenting with sexuality, or be called to work on traumas and fears that are affecting you."
