The Empress represents fertility and creation, and embracing a softer side of yourself.

If you get this card, then there are a few messages you may be receiving. The Empress is a strong pregnancy card - if you are trying for children then good news may be coming your way. However, pregnancy is not the only thing she offers. She calls you to nurture yourself, or can be a sign that you wish to be nurtured and seek compassion. 

She also represents abundance and luxuries.
