The Lovers brings romantic and spiritual connection, with clear communication about your beliefs and values.

If you get this card, you may have or about to meet a new romantic interest - possibly someone you are supposed to be with. You will need to be clear about your values and communicate honestly with one another, but trust that it should be right for you. 

In other contexts, The Lovers can also represent business partnerships, or represent your own heart and the need to connect with yourself spiritually. They also represent friendships and other platonic relationships.
