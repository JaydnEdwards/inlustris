meaning:
    general: 'The Moon represents fears, dreams and projection, as well as intuition and dreams.'
    example: "If you get this card then you may be projecting your fears and anxieties onto other people or situations. If this is the case, you may need to deal with a painful memory. This card also represents that things may not be as they seem and you should keep an eye out for lies and secrets. Additionally, this card alludes to your dreams and tells you to take notice, as your dreams are often your subconscious dealing with your waking issues."
