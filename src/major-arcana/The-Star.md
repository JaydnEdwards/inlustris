The Star represents a renewed sense of faith, spirituality and self.

If you get this card then you may be in for a reprieve. You may start to feel a renewed sense of faith - whether that's in yourself, others or a higher power. Things may start to feel like they're going your way and you may start to search for a renewed purpose or meaning.
