meaning:
    general: 'The Tower represents struggle and hard times, often with chaos and revalations.'
    example: "If you get this card then you may be in - or are going to be in - a situation where things are going to change quite suddenly and it's going to be chaotic. There may be things coming to light, or you may be in for an awakening where you suddenly see things in a new light. This change can also be within yourself. This can be scary and difficult to go through, but you may come out a better person for it."
