The World represents success, things coming to completion and travel. The world is stretched out before you.

If you get this card then travel is on the table for you. You may also be close to finishing a project or closing a deal. This is a sign that you are going to succeed. It is also a sign of your dreams coming to fruition. 

Opportunities may also arise and start coming your way. It's like the universe is smiling at you.
