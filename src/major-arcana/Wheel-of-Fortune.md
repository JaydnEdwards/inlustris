meaning:
    general: 'The Wheel of Fortune represents karma coming for you and being helped toward your destiny. It also represents transitioning from a hard time to a better one, or from a high point to normality.'
    example: 'The Wheel also represents outside forces, such as karma, so if you like to hold control then you may feel helpless - know that this is helping you toward your destiny. This card also represents karmic action, so be prepared to receive what you hand out. If you help others, expect help in return. If you have hurt someone, be prepared to get hurt in turn.'
