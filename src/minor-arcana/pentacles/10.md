The ten of pentacles represents strong foundations and traditions. It is a card of family and is viewed through the lens of finance. You have built your foundations and are now in or are approaching a time of permenancy. You have become financially secure and want for very little.

### Windfall

There is a chance you will receive a financial windfall coming via family. This could be through an inheritance or family business.

### Family

When applied to family, the ten of pentacles may be saying you are providing for your family, whatever shape that family may take. It could be just you, you and your partner(s), pets, found family, roommates or just your blood family. Whatever family means to you.

It can also represent that family is important to you and being around your family brings you joy.

### The future

You may wish to start building upon your foundations to provide for your family in the future.  That could mean writing a will, or setting up trust funds. It can only help to be prepared.
