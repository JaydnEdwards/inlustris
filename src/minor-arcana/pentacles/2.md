It looks like you may be juggling a few things at once. That might be balancing home and work, multiple jobs, or other competing priorities. You might be struggling and in need of help, or you might be feeling great about how you're handling things.

You need to be careful. It doesn't take long for things to go wrong when you have a lot on your plate and you might lose control. Take this card as permission to take breaks and a signal to look for ways to help managing your priorities. That could be to-do lists, diaries or even hiring an assistant or mentor.
