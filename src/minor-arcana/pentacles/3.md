The three of pentacles shows us the completion of a project or goal, which is usually achieved with support from and collaboration with others.

If you haven't done so already, take some time to plan out your goals and how you will achieve them.

When read in the negative, the Three of Pentacles also represents disharmony, working alone and competition. Be wary of others fighting against you, and reach out for support where you need it.
