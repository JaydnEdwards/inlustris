The four of pentacles represents someone clinging to money.

When read in the positive, the four of pentacles is someone financially stable who is maybe achieving their goals or building up their savings.

However, when read in the negative, the four of pentacles can also represent valuing material wealth over other things, such as family or self, or someone who is hoarding their wealth. Compulsive frugality can be self-destructive so take care if this resonates.
