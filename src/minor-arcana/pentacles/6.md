quote: 'Money is not the only commodity that is fun to give. We can give time, we can give our expertise, we can give our love, or simply give a smile. What does that cost? The point is, none of us can ever run out of something worthwhile to give.'

The six of pentacles shows that you may have a good relationship with money at the moment; you have very little stress and may be in a position to help out someone else. However you may also be the one receiving help.

This card isn't just about money though; the help described by this card could also be time or just being there for someone when they need it (or someone being there for you, if you are the one receiving help).

If someone helps you, then return the favour at some point in the future!
