The seven of pentacles represents reaping the rewards of a long-term investment involving hard work and planning. This is most certainly not a card of quick wins.

If you have been planning to invest in something (whether that is time, effort or money) in something, or you already are investing, then take this as a positive affirmation and a sign that things will work out.

Remember though - this is a long-term card. These things will take lots of time, effort and planning before coming to fruition. Be patient. You will be rewarded.
