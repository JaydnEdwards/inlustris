The eight of pentacles is a card that represents hard work, dedication and developing your skills. You may be working your skills in a professional or personal capacity, or you may be about to enter a period of time where you will be doing so. 

You may even be starting or about to start to learn new skills! If so, take this as a positive sign to start your journey.

It won't always be easy, so ask for help when you need it! Do remember though that it is ultimately up to you to work on yourself.
