The nine of pentacles is a beautifully positive card that represents success and abundance. Things are turning out really well for you.

It's time to enjoy some well-earned financial freedom and luxury. Perhaps you can buy yourself something as a treat!

When representing a person, this card describes someone who is strong, confident and perhaps even sophisticated. They are typically a woman, are otherwise effeminate, in touch with or at peace with their own feminimity.
