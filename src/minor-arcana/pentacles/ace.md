The Ace of Pentacles shows wealth and abundance in financial matters, but also across all aspects of life. You should see this as a go-ahead; you've been given permission to make a start on your goals. You can achieve anything you put your mind to, so it's time to start manifesting.

Watch out for incoming financial or career opportunities. They may be on their way, but it's up to you to make the most of them.
