The knight of pentacles is a card driven by action, hard work and consistency. It says you are - or perhaps you are needing to start - working towards your goals. This might not happen as quick as you would like, but that's okay! Keep ploughing through at your own pace and you'll get there in the end. Be patient with yourself!

This card is also a good sign that your current routine and approach to your work is working for you! You should keep at it the way you are now.
