The page of pentacles brings good news and opportunities. It is a signal of you manifesting your goals. However, it is the start of the journey toward those goals and not the end of it.

You may be considering a new venture, such as starting a business, going down a new career path, or something like buying a new home.

Take this as a sign to start seriously planning out your goals and how you will realistically reach them.

It's time to think about your future in the long run.
