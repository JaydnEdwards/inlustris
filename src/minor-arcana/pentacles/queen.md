The queen of pentacles is a very positive card. She is warm and nurturing. She is also an independent queen; through her own hard work, she has everything she needs.

This card tells us to be more independent, to maintain a stable income and set enough time for ourselves and our loved ones. This might be something you have not yet achieved but are working towards. If that's the case then take this as a positive sign.

When representing a person, the queen is a practical yet compassionate person that helps - or wants to help - us navigate through life. That could be a family member, a friend, a teacher or mentor, or even a counsellor.

This is also what the queen asks of us; be calm and nurturing with other people but be practical and resourceful if and when issues appear. She also asks that we give ourselves enough time to rest and care for ourselves, otherwise we might burn out.
