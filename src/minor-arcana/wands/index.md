The Major Arcana is made up of 22 cards. Each card has a high-level meaning that represents an Archetype. For example, the first card in the Major Arcana is the Fool archetype, who is about to begin a journey. When placed in numerical order, the Major Arcana tells the story of the Foolâ€™s journey from the beginning, through the highs and lows, all to the completion of the journey.
